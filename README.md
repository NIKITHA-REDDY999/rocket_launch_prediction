# rocket_launch_prediction
Rocket Launch Data Analysis using R
📌 About the Project

I have recently learned the R programming language, and this project is my first practical application of R in data analysis.

The goal of this project is to analyze rocket launch data, perform data cleaning, visualization, and basic machine learning, and understand what factors influence the success of a rocket launch.

🎯 What I Learned & Applied

Data loading and inspection in R

Data cleaning and handling missing values

Feature engineering using date-time data

Data visualization using ggplot2

Building a logistic regression model

Evaluating model accuracy

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

R Programming

ggplot2

lubridate

Logistic Regression (GLM)

📂 Dataset Information

File used: output_file.csv

Target variable: success

1 → Successful launch

0 → Failed launch

Features Used:

Flight Number

Rocket Type

Launchpad

Launch Year

Launch Window

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

I visualized:

Overall launch success vs failure

Launch success trends over the years

Success rate across different launchpads

These visualizations helped me understand patterns in launch outcomes.

🤖 Model Building

Model: Logistic Regression

Data split: 80% training, 20% testing

Accuracy achieved: ~94%

▶️ How to Run

Install R and RStudio

Keep output_file.csv in the same folder

Run:

source("rocket_analysis.R")

🌱 Future Scope

Add more features to improve prediction

Try advanced ML models in R

Build interactive dashboards using Shiny
